# FlaskRestxAPI

### Created API using Flask restx following Model View Controller Pattern
### This API returns json files and this files are tested in Postman
### Postman is an application used for API testing. It is an HTTP client that tests HTTP requests, utilizing a graphical user interface, through which we obtain different types of responses that need to be subsequently validated. 

### Postman offers many endpoint interaction methods. The following are some of the most used, including their functions:

#### GET: Obtain information 
#### POST: Add information
#### PUT: Replace information
#### PATCH: Update certain information
#### DELETE: Delete information

### When testing APIs with Postman, we usually obtain different response codes. Some of the most common include:

#### 100 Series > Temporal responses, for example, ‘102 Processing’.
#### 200 Series > Responses where the client accepts the request and the server processes it successfully, for instance, ‘200 Ok’.
#### 300 Series  > Responses related to URL redirection, for example, ‘301 Moved Permanently.’
#### 400 Series  > Client error responses, for instance, ‘400 Bad Request’.
#### 500 Series > Server error responses, for example, ‘500 Internal Server Error.’
